# helloREST

Simple module demonstrating the use of a WebServer 
and Heroku deployment.

## How to use the demo

Copy the entire folder into an individual folder. 
Initialize it with `git init`, and subsequently, initialize the app with `heroku create`. Make sure that `heroku` is listed as one of the remotes of your repo.  Then (re-)deploy your app after changes to heroku by calling:
`git push heroku master`
